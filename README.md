# 📚✨ LITSCAPE  
### An Automated Literature Analysis & Research Trend Discovery Platform  
*Turning academic papers into structured insights and visual knowledge maps*

---

## 🧠 Introduction

**LITSCAPE** is an **open-source, Jupyter Notebook–based literature analysis platform** designed to help researchers make sense of large volumes of academic papers with minimal manual effort.

The project automates the process of:
- Collecting academic papers
- Identifying relevance using **semantic similarity**
- Extracting research themes
- Visualizing trends over time

By combining:
- Natural Language Processing (NLP)
- Semantic embedding models
- Topic modeling
- Data visualization  

LITSCAPE transforms scattered research papers into **clear, interpretable insights**.

## 🖼️ Outputs / Sample Outputs

All outputs generated by the notebook are stored in the `outputs/` directory.

## ⚙️ How It Works

### 1. Search Configuration
Users define:
- Research query (e.g., *plant disease detection*)
- Publication year range
- Number of topics to extract
- Reference descriptions defining relevance

### 2. Paper Collection
The notebook automatically retrieves papers from:
- OpenAlex
- arXiv  

Papers are filtered based on publication year and abstract availability.

### 3. Relevance Scoring
Each abstract is:
- Cleaned and preprocessed
- Converted into semantic embeddings
- Compared against user-provided reference descriptions  

A **relevance score** is assigned, and only papers above a chosen threshold are retained.

### 4. Analysis & Visualization
On the filtered dataset, the system attempts to:
- Perform topic modeling
- Extract key research terms
- Visualize publication trends
- Generate topic-wise paper distributions
- Create topic trend heatmaps over time

All results are saved to the `outputs/` folder.

## 🎯 Purpose

LITSCAPE aims to reduce the **manual burden of literature reviews** by offering a reproducible, automated, and customizable research analysis workflow.

It is useful for:
- Early-stage research exploration
- Trend identification across years
- Understanding dominant themes in a research field
- Supporting systematic literature reviews

## 👤 User Instructions

1. Open the Jupyter Notebook  
2. Define search query, year range, and reference descriptions  
3. Run the data collection and relevance scoring cells  
4. Set an appropriate relevance threshold  
5. Execute analysis and visualization cells  
6. Review generated results inside:

## ⚠️ Known Issues

- After relevance filtering, remaining abstracts may be:
- Too few in number
- Dominated by common or non-informative words
- This can result in:
- Empty vocabulary errors during topic modeling
- Failed keyword extraction
- Missing or incomplete visualizations

These issues usually occur when the relevance threshold is set too high.

---

## 🚀 Future Plans

- Adaptive relevance thresholding
- TF-IDF fallback for sparse datasets
- Improved text preprocessing (lemmatization, domain stopwords)
- More robust topic modeling approaches
- Modularization into a reusable research toolkit
- Optional web-based interface
